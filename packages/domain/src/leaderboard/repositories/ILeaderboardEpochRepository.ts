 * Lifecycle of the per-epoch distribution row.

 *    The row stays `status='pending'` until the indexer confirms.
 *  - `markConfirmed` is called by the LeaderboardIndexer when `EpochClosed`
 *    is observed; it backfills `epoch_id`, `prize_pool`, `claim_expiry`.
 *  - `markRolledOver` flips a confirmed epoch when `EpochRolledOver` lands.
 *  - `findClaimable` returns confirmed, non-expired epochs whose
 *    `leaves_json` contains the user — drives the claim banner UI.
