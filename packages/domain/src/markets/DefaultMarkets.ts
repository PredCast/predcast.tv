/**
 * Canonical lineup of markets seeded on every freshly-deployed
 * FootballPariMatch contract. ChilizTV exposes EXACTLY these 6 product
 * types (8 markets because GOALS_TOTAL has 2 lines and DOUBLE_CHANCE has 3
 * variants):
 *
 *   1. 1X2                                          (WINNER)
 *   2. 1X2 mi-temps                                  (HALFTIME)
 *   3. Over/Under 1.5 goals                          (GOALS_TOTAL line=15)
 *   4. Over/Under 2.5 goals                          (GOALS_TOTAL line=25)
 *   5. Both teams score                              (BOTH_SCORE)
 *   6. Double Chance — 1X, 12, 2X                    (DOUBLE_CHANCE × 3)
 *
 * The order below IS the on-chain `marketId` order (addMarketsBatch indexes
 * 0..N). Re-ordering this list changes which market a placed bet refers to
 * — DO NOT reorder casually. The behavioural-equivalence test in
 * apps/backend asserts the 2 adapters consume the same payload, but it
 * does NOT detect a re-order that's coherent across both adapters.
 *
 * Adding a new market type at the end is safe. Inserting in the middle
 * shifts every following marketId — reserved for a separate migration
 * with explicit contract upgrade plan.
